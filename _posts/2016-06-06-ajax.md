##### Ajax introduction

This is another high level look at asynchronous javascript aka Ajax. Ajax allows for content to be retrieved and then displayed without reloading the web page. The asynchronous bit means that it is non blocking. This means that other events can happen at the same time.

The data returned can be xml, json or html. This data is usually loaded dynamically onto the page. If you have seen new posts pop up on Facebook without you having to refresh the page, you have seen ajax in action! In fact you can go to any website and open the developer tools and then click on the network tab. Refresh the page and scroll down the website you are on. On a site that uses ajax you will a xhr type. That is ajax!

I will be continuing this Ajax introduction in the near future as I believe it's really important to understand what purpose it serves.
