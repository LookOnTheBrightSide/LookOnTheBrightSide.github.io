introduction: So ... I helped someone with their code

### Friday night ...
It's a friday night and I'am still trying to grok Claude Shannon's Information Entropy, I decide to take a break. During the break I go back to my roots, FREE CODE CAMP! In between the chats someone asks for help. It's a jquery question and they seem to be frustrated. I offer to to help even though my JS is rusty right now. Within seconds I solve the problem. I ask the person what they've tried and they private message me their code. Turns out they are are not far off. It's just a spelling mistake! We correct the spelling mistake but the code still won't pass. Turns out they changed so much stuff after after the first error and that led even more errors! With a fresh pair of eyes we were able to find the problem, an extra bracket!!

TIL: An extra/fresh pair of eyes is all you need sometimes!
