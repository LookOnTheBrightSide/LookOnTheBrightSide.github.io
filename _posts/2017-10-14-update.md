What have I been up to?
For our summer research project we were presented with a [dataset](https://data.dublinked.ie/dataset/dublin-bus-gps-sample-data-from-dublin-city-council-insight-project){:target="_blank" .site-link} (7GB csv files) and were tasked with 
implementing supervised learning predictive models to calculate how long any trip would take.

- algorithm required to route passangers if start stop and end stop are not on the same route

- some routes didn't have enough data for training
