In brushing up my JavaScript and to learn React, I built a simple application that consumes data provided by the Dublin Bus Api. The app displays all due buses for any submitted bus stop number. It shows the results in sequential order starting with the earliest. The app can be seen [here](https://dubh.me)

Below is what the app looks like:

Until next time! ✌🏾
